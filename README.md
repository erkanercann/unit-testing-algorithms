## Unit Testing Algorithms

This repository is created to solve various algorithmic questions and test these algorithms using the Jest testing framework.

### How to Use

Each algorithm has a separate file. Each file contains a JavaScript function. You can edit these files to use the algorithm and see the results or include them in another project.

Tests are available for each algorithm. To run the tests, make sure to have Jest installed (you can install it using `npm install`). Then, use the following command to run the tests for each algorithm:

```
npm test
```
